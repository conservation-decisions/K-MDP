K-Markov Decision Process (K-MDP)

Author: Jonathan Ferrer Mestres

The K-MDP toolbox includes a set of algorithms for solving K-MDPs: given an original MDP and a constraint on the 
number of states (K),  generate a reduced state space MDP that  minimizes  the  difference  between  the  original  
optimalMDP value function and the reduced optimal K-MDP value function.

The K-MDP toolbox was developed by the Conservation Decisions team of the Land and Water unit of CSIRO (Australia).
